      Set in Detroit during the year 2038, the city has been revitalized by the invention and introduction of androids into everyday life. But when androids start behaving as if they are alive, events begin to spin out of control. Step into the roles of the story's pivotal three playable characters (Kara, Connor, and Markus), each with unique perspectives, motivations and abilities as they face their true selves and question their values. These three androids are present throughout the game as they follow through an emotional journey with choices that must be taken in order for their ultimate 'cause', which can be defined many different ways depending on the values of the player. The plot of the game deals with a variety of mature themes that explore moral ground and each player decision affects what will happen.

    <p class="text">
      Detroit: Become Human is played from a third-person view, which is subject to a set and controllable perspective. The right analogue stick on the DualShock controller is used to interact with objects and observe one's surroundings, the left is for movement, and R2 scans an environment for possible actions; the motion controls and touchpad are also employed. The gameplay is similar to the company's 3rd title Heavy Rain, though similar inputs like prompted quick time events and dialogue decisions are still part of the gameplay. Therefore, the story will branch out depending on which choices are made.
      For action sequences or contextual interactions, players are presented with various symbols, requiring them to either press buttons, move the right analogue stick in a certain way, or shake or tilt the controller. In action sequences, such as when the playable character is being attacked, failure to execute these commands takes the story along a different path, and certain mistakes can lead to a character's death. However, in some cases, a timed sequence plays out before the playable character meets his/her demise. The game presents several routes that players can take. To end the playable character's predicament, players have to find the correct route before the timer at the bottom runs out.
